Times and timezones are being handled in the following manner:

- All database times are in UTC
- All times in memory (variables, active records, etc) are in the user's current site's timezone
- With the exception of low-level database code which reads/writes from/to the database, all code
  should assume that all times are in the user's current timezone (no converting necessary)
- PHP's date() function should NEVER be used, instead use util::get_datetime_object() to get a
  PHP DateTime object which tracks time zone.
- All time, date and datetime type columns MUST either be named after their type or end in an
  underscore and their type (ie: date, start_date, prior_datetime, etc)
- All timestamp type columns MUST be named "timestamp", "datetime" or end in "_datetime".
