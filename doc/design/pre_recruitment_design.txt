Pre-recruitment individual selection tool
=========================================

This tool will be used to help randomly select one individual from a household.  The individual is
selected from a list of all individuals in a household which belong to a quota stratum.  The number
of individuals in each quota is recorded and associated with a participant record along with the
individual which was selected.
