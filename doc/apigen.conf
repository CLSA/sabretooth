# tricky (and is not completely realiable). Moreover autodetection slows down the
# process of generating documentation. You can also use the parameter multiple times
# to provide a list of all used character sets in your documentation. In that case
# ApiGen will choose one of provided character sets for each file.
# Usage: charset: <list>
