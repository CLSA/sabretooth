1.1.8
====================================================================================================

* Scheduled calls
  - In the participant's details a new "Scheduled Call" list has been added
  - Added new category to queue similar to appointments
  - Participants are held in "waiting" queue until scheduled call time arrives at which point they
    are assigned in priority after appointments

1.1.7
====================================================================================================

* Supervisors now have full list/view/add/delete access to operator away times
  - existing away times user, start and end times can be changed
  - new away times can be added to users with operator access to the supervisor's site
  - away times must always have no operator activity between the start/end times

* Adding caching ability to select reports
  - cached reports are generated overnight to save processing and wait time

* Changing participant status report to have new "Breakdown by" and "Province" options
  - breakdown includes old "site or province" options and the new "quota" option
  - breaking down by quota organizes the report into quota categories (gender & age group)
  - province option restricts to participants who's primary address is in that province

* Queues have been thinned out to improve performance
  - outside calling time is now higher in the tree
  - "machine message" and "machine no message" have been combined into the "not reached" queue
  - "always available" has been merged into the "not available" queue
  - performance has been internally improved

* Adding email address to participant view
  - This property is synched with the email address in Mastodon

* Added new appointment report
  - Report can be ran by supervisors for any one day, shows list of all appointments on that day

====================================================================================================
1.1.6
====================================================================================================

* Participant status report restriction by participant synch date
  - This report now has a start/end date parameters which restricts the list based on when the
    participant was created in Sabretooth

* Adding quotas (full list/view/add/delete functionality)
  - Quotas are application linked, so changes made in Sabretooth will be changed in Mastodon as well

* Queue restriction by quota
  - Quotas include a "disabled" column which, when set to true, removes those participants from the
    calling queues

* Listen in to phone calls
  - Supervisors can now listen-in to their operator's live phone calls
  - The assignment list (as well as the "open assignment list") has a magnifying glass to connect to
    a call
  - Viewing an assignment also has a "listen in" button (when the assignment has a call which is
    active)

* Calendar date persistence
  - Calendars don't reset to today's date after changing event

* Various bug fixes

====================================================================================================

====================================================================================================

* View details added to appointment view
  - When viewing appointments a new "view details" button has been added which shows the
    participant's details
  - The participant's UID has been added to the appointment view

* Mailout report (Val's first contribution to Sabretooth!)
  - this report allows administrators to prepare mail-merges to mail information and/or proxy
    packages to participants
  - report can be broken down by site and source

* Sorting queues by age on weekdays
  - All queues are now sorted by age (oldest to youngest) on weekdays
  - A new setting "queue","reverse sort time" defines the time where the sorting is reversed from
    youngest to oldest
  - The default is 5pm so that older participants are (preferentially) called during the day and
    younger participants
    called in the evenings
  - The reverse sort time setting is based on the operator's time zone, not the participant's

* Various bug fixes

====================================================================================================
1.1.4
====================================================================================================

* Secondary contact script added to system
  - Operators will now see a "Secondary Contacts" button when they are assigned a participants who
    has had 10+ failed call attempts
  - The number of failed call attempts (default 10) is a setting which can be set individually by
    each site.
  - Clicking the secondary contact button will provide a list of alternates who can be called using
    the secondary contact script
  - Operators MUST still call the participant at least once before ending their assignment, even if
    they call a secondary
  - Admins and supervisors will see a secondary button in the participant view page for participants
    with 10+ failed call attempts

* Opal integration completed
  - There is now an option to add an "Opal Instance" to Sabretooth
  - Opal instances gain access to all collected data in the 60-minute interview
  - Admins do not need to do anything here, I will be managing Opal instances personally

* Availability changed from "only call when" to "prefer calling when"
  - operators are not restricted to calling participants within available times anymore, instead
    availability only causes a priority in queues
  - all availability sub-queues now have the three "ready to call" options:
    1. call participants who are currently available
    2. call participants who are always available
    3. call participants who are not currently available

* Supervisors now see an "open assignment" list in their home screen.
  - when first logging in at the "home" screen supervisors will see a list of all open assignments
  - this may be useful to track down operators who may have accidentally forgotten to close
    assignments

* Various bug fixes
