1.1.5
====================================================================================================

* View details added to appointment view
  - When viewing appointments a new "view details" button has been added which shows the
    participant's details
  - The participant's UID has been added to the appointment view

* Mailout report (Val's first contribution to Sabretooth!)
  - this report allows administrators to prepare mail-merges to mail information and/or proxy
    packages to participants
  - report can be broken down by site and source

* Sorting queues by age on weekdays
  - All queues are now sorted by age (oldest to youngest) on weekdays
  - A new setting "queue","reverse sort time" defines the time where the sorting is reversed from
    youngest to oldest
  - The default is 5pm so that older participants are (preferentially) called during the day and
    younger participants
    called in the evenings
  - The reverse sort time setting is based on the operator's time zone, not the participant's

* Various bug fixes

1.1.4
====================================================================================================

* Secondary contact script added to system
  - Operators will now see a "Secondary Contacts" button when they are assigned a participants who
    has had 10+ failed call attempts
  - The number of failed call attempts (default 10) is a setting which can be set individually by
    each site.
  - Clicking the secondary contact button will provide a list of alternates who can be called using
    the secondary contact script
  - Operators MUST still call the participant at least once before ending their assignment, even if
    they call a secondary
  - Admins and supervisors will see a secondary button in the participant view page for participants
    with 10+ failed call attempts

* Opal integration completed
  - There is now an option to add an "Opal Instance" to Sabretooth
  - Opal instances gain access to all collected data in the 60-minute interview
  - Admins do not need to do anything here, I will be managing Opal instances personally

* Availability changed from "only call when" to "prefer calling when"
  - operators are not restricted to calling participants within available times anymore, instead
    availability only causes a priority in queues
  - all availability sub-queues now have the three "ready to call" options:
    1. call participants who are currently available
    2. call participants who are always available
    3. call participants who are not currently available

* Supervisors now see an "open assignment" list in their home screen.
  - when first logging in at the "home" screen supervisors will see a list of all open assignments
  - this may be useful to track down operators who may have accidentally forgotten to close
    assignments

* Various bug fixes
